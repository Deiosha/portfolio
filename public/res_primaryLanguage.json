    "description": "ðŸ‘‹ I'm Deiosha Sparks. Before I decided to change careers, I worked at UW Medicine as a Medical Assistant, and I'm a Junior attending the University of Washington. I enjoy solving complex problems because programming challenges me to be creative and improves my problem-solving skills. I have always been interested in learning more about game development, and I wanted to get the fundamental skills of a software developer by taking this Code Fellows course so I can explore that in the future. During my free time, I enjoy spending time with my family and friends. Thank you ðŸ’œ",

Some key features include keeping a card hidden unless hovered to help with user memory and saving the user name and score into local storage to display on the scoreboard. We used HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and DOM Manipulation to build our project and ensured proper gitflow to GitHub to store our project.",

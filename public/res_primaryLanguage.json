      "description": "ðŸ‘‹ I'm Deiosha Sparks. Before I decided to change careers, I worked at UW Medicine as a Medical Assistant, and I'm a Junior attending the University of Washington. I enjoy solving complex problems because programming challenges me to be creative and improves my problem-solving skills. I have always been interested in learning more about game development, and I wanted to get the fundamental skills of a software developer by taking this Code Fellows course so I can explore that in the future. During my free time, I enjoy spending time with my family and friends. Thank you ðŸ’œ",
